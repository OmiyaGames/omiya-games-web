    "keywords": "Omiya Games - Web A set of libraries Omiya Games uses to support web-related features and activities. Install There are two common methods for installing this package. Through Unity Package Manager Unity's own Package Manager supports importing packages through a URL to a Git repo : First, on this repository page, click the \"Clone or download\" button, and copy over this repository's HTTPS URL. Then click on the + button on the upper-left-hand corner of the Package Manager, select \"Add package from git URL...\" on the context menu, then paste this repo's URL! While easy and straightforward, this method has a few major downside: it does not support dependency resolution and package upgrading when a new version is released. To add support for that, the following method is recommended: Through OpenUPM Installing via OpenUPM's command line tool is recommended because it supports dependency resolution, upgrading, and downgrading this package. If you haven't already installed OpenUPM , you can do so through Node.js's npm (obviously have Node.js installed in your system first): npm install -g openupm-cli Then, to install this package, just run the following command at the root of your Unity project: openupm add com.omiyagames.web Resources Documentation Change Log LICENSE Overall package is licensed under MIT , unless otherwise noted in the 3rd party licenses file and/or source code.
